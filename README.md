Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
They required a secure file verification step using a checksum and encryption of communication channels by converting from HTTP to HTTPS. The focus was on improving security protocols and meeting industry best practices.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I was good in file verification and communication encryption. I addressed this by integrating secure communication mechanisms, such as generating self-signed certificates, and ensuring HTTPS communication. I excelled at identifying and documenting software vulnerabilities by performing thorough static and functional testing. Coding securely is crucial because it protects against cyber threats, data breaches, and potential financial loss. Strong software security boosts a company's reputation and safeguards its operations and customer data.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was managing false positives and determining the actual security threats.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security by generating self-signed certificates, refactoring the code to follow best practices, and conducting secondary testing. In the future, I would rely on tools like OWASP Dependency-Check

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the application remained functional by running unit and integration tests. I verified that no new vulnerabilities were introduced through follow-up static analysis and reviewing logs for unexpected behavior.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Java Keytool, Eclipse, and secure coding practices that emphasized encryption, validation, and exception handling.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would showcase my ability to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities, successfully implement encryption, and ensure secure communication protocols.
